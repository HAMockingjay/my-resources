# my-resources
A collection of tools and resources I use that others have found helpful

## Anime-related
### Information
- [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/) - A site that is used to generated the information for Anime Music Quiz's database, super helpful for finding out what songs are in shows.
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) - A list managing site that has a wealth of information.
- [AniList](https://anilist.co/) - Another list managing site that has better social features than MAL, but less information embeded. Maintained by user submissions. Has some add-ons that make it much more feature complete.
- [WAIT: What Anime Is This](https://trace.moe/) - Otherwise known by it's URL (trace.moe), this tool allows you to upload anime screenshots and it will look for a source.
### Tools/Add-ons
- [Automail](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370473-automail) - A userscript add-on for AniList that adds a multitude of new features. My personal favorites include 1. separate coloring of anime and manga pages, 2. more detailed profile stats pages, 3. the ability to view score averages from just the people you're following, 4. moving the toolbar to the left hand side of the screen, 5. importing serialization and OP/ED info from MAL, and 6. custom profile CSS.
- [Animouto](https://www.animouto.moe/) - A browser add-on that sits in your toolbar and provides a minimal AniList UI at a glance. I use this to update my manga progress while I'm reading, as well as check notifications.
- [AL Search](https://yellowfish085.github.io/al-search/) - Browser add-on for quickly searching on AniList. I use it to easily search for titles by just highlighting them and selecting the search option from the context menu. Makes it very easy to add shows to your AL straight from AMQ.
### Games
- [Anime Music Quiz](https://animemusicquiz.com/) - The quintessential experience of suffering. Configurable with a lot of options, commonly you'll get 20 seconds to listen to an opening, ending, or insert song from an anime. Customizable to play at a variety of skill levels, it's something I'd highly recommend trying to everyone. I'm addicted and need help.
##### Recommended userscripts for AMQ (use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey)
- [Chat Timestamps](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqChatTimestamps.user.js) - Adds timestamps to chat, helpful for slow moving chat rooms.
- [Dice Roller](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqChatTimestamps.user.js) - Adds a /roll command to chat, allowing you to roll a die when you go to answer. Useful for when you know something is part of a series but not sure what season.
- [Rig Tracker](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqRigTracker.user.js) (alt [Rig Tracker Lite](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqRigTrackerLite.user.js)) - Shows you how many songs appear in each game from each person's list. Really good for telling when your opponents are carried by rig luck.
- [Song List UI](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqSongListUI.user.js) - Adds a button for showing a list of all songs that have played during your current session. Searchable by many different fields, including song title artist, show, your own answer, etc.
